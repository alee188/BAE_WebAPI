# BAE_WebAPI
Testing Coverage:75.6%  
# MoviesAPI

This project was to create a back-end movies database and a front-end local webpage that you can send HTTPS requests to the database, So that the database entries can be manipulated to have CRUD functionalities of create, read, update and delete.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

**Front-end**
*JavaScript - Axios
*CSS -Bootstrap
*HTML
*IDE used: Visual Studio Code

**Back-end**
*IDE used: Eclipse â€“ Java
*Postman: to test the HTTPS requests
*MySQL: to host the local database 

## Running the tests

Aim of testing is to achieve a scr/main/java coverage of 80%+. Tests can be divided into integration tests and unit tests, A integration test tests the entire API to see if there is an error with the programme. However, if there is an error with the API is it difficult to understand which function is causing the error with integration testing alone, therefore with multiple unit tests this can fault find the error by isolating individual function of the API and blocking any interactions with other functions to see if these isolated functions pass or fail.   

 the purpose of this is
